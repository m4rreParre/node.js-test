#NodeJS Practice

Welcome to my Node.js practice repository! ðŸš€

About

This is just a place where I've been fooling around and experimenting with Node.js for fun. I'm new to it and wanted to get a feel for how it works. No serious projects hereâ€”just learning and playing around!

What I'm Learning

How to set up and run a Node.js environment

Basics of JavaScript on the backend

How web servers work

Handling requests and responses

Trying out different Node.js modules

Running the Code

If you want to check out what I've been doing:

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/m4rreParre/node.js-test.git

Navigate into the project folder:

cd node.js-test

Run a script (if there's one available):

node filename.js

Future Plans

As I keep learning, I'll try building simple web servers, exploring Express.js, and maybe even creating a small project.

Feel free to check out my progress! ðŸ˜ƒ
