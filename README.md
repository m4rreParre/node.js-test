# NodeJS Practice ðŸš€

Welcome to my Node.js practice repository!

## About  
This is just a place where I've been fooling around and experimenting with Node.js for fun.  
I'm new to it and wanted to get a feel for how it works. No serious projects hereâ€”just learning and playing around!

## What I'm Learning  
- How to set up and run a Node.js environment  
- Basics of JavaScript on the backend  
- How web servers work  
- Handling requests and responses  
- Trying out different Node.js modules  

## Running the Code  
If you want to check out what I've been doing:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.  
2. Clone this repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/m4rreParre/node.js-test.git
3. Navigate to project folder:
   ```sh
   cd node.js-test
4. Run basic-server.js:
   ```sh
      node basic-server.js:
## Future Plans
As I keep learning, I'll try building simple web servers, exploring Express.js, and maybe even creating a small project.

Feel free to check out my progress! ðŸ˜ƒ
